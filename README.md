# Beejs-Guide-to-Networking-Study
Small study of networking using [Beej's guide](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/) and
HTTP stuff from [cirosantilli](https://github.com/cirosantilli/linux-kernel-module-cheat).<br>
The intention was to utilize the least amount of libraries and make it bare bones and fast.
